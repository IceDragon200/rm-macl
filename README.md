## Introduction
Formely known as RGSS3-MACL, the RM-MACL is a set of modules and classes
which aim to extend the RPG Maker VXA standard code, by providing new
functionality and utilities.
This library is aimed at scripters, but may be useful to general users.
V3.0.0 is a somewhat clean start, some duplicate classes where removed
and ease of use was increased.
An effort to document each module has been made.
